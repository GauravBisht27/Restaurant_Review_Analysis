# Restaurant_Review_Analysis
In this we have reviewed all the reviews given to a restaurant by using multiple algorithmns( SVC, Naive Bayes, Pipelining) and selected the best possible model out of them using joblib and created a streamlit webapp using the best model to predict whether the review is positive or negative.
